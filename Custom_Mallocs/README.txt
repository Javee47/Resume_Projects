This is a project I did for my operating systems class that is about making custom versions of malloc. I had to implement multiple memory selection algorithmss such as next-fit, best-fit, and so on. If you want to look at the oringinal assignment it should be on https://github.com/CSE3320/Heap-Assignment. 
There you should find the original template programs he provided to see how it compares to my finished assignment

This program is designed to be run on a linux enviroment since it uses things from posix namely unistd.h. You should be able to compile it using the attached makefile. 
It's already setup so that each command compiles for a different malloc algorithm and there are tests you can mess around with in the tests folder to see how well it works.
