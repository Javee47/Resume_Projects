This a project I did for my programming languages class. Basically it was just to show us how to make lambda functions in java and how they compare to imperative funcitons. The assignment desciption should be in the folder labeled as "HMWK_05.txt"

You should be able to compile it and run it on anything that has java installed. This program doesn't require input it just prints all the results of the functions within a hard coded range.
