This a project I did for my operating systems class. I was tasked with parelellizing a fractal image generator. The original assignment template should be on https://github.com/CSE3320/Fractal-Assignment.

It is meant to be ran on a linux system since it uses libraries from posix such as the pthreads themselves. It should be compilable using gcc.

Running the program with "mandel -h" should print a help page that teaches you how to use it. After sucessfully running it with the correct paremters it should output a bitmap.
