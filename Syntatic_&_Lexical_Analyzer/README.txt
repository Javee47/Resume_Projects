This a project I did for my compilers class. I was tasked with creating a syntatic and lexical analyzer that was able to recognize precedence and do simple math.

The program uses a libary called ply which is an implementation of lex and yacc in python. I've only ever gotten the ply libary to work on linux so I think it might use something preinstalled on that operating system unless I'm making some mistake. 
It should be compilable using regular old python 3 all it needs is an input txt. I've provided the test txts that my professor used to grade this assignment.
