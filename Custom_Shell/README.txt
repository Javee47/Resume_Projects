This is a project I did for my operating systems class to make a custom shell. If you want to look at the oringinal assignment it should be on https://github.com/CSE3320/Shell-Assignment. There you should find the original template programs he provided to see how it compares to my finished assignment

This program is designed to be run on a linux enviroment since it uses things from posix namely unistd.h. You should be able to compile it and run it using gcc. There should also be the assignment description in the foulder labelled "Assignment 1 Shell.pdf". 
This should list all the different funcionality and specifications of the shell.
